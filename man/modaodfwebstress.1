.SH SYNOPSIS
modaodfwebstress [OPTIONS] SERVER PATH1 TRACE1 ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Re-play trace files, either gzip compressed or verbatim against
a given server URL to simulate load against the server. A single
modaodfwebstress command can easily replay many concurrent traces.
.PP
If the same PATH is provided for multiple traces, then these are
both executed against the same document.

.SS "Generating traces"
To generate a trace, set the following settings to these values in:
\fBmodaodfweb.xml\fR: \fBtrace\fR true, \fBtrace.path\fR /tmp/trace.txt.gz
.PP
Re-start modaodfweb, edit some documents and then load and

.SH "NOTE"
Please note that recording traces generated by mashing the keyboard rapidly creates a pathologically
unrealistic profile that is 10x faster than the average typer, and 5x worse then a professional typist
in terms of keys-per-second, as well as creating unusual documents from a spell/grammar checking
perspective.
